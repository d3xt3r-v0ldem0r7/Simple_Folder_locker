# Simple_Folder_locker
simple folder locker for windows using traditional batch processing

i used batch to easily access the windows commands so, i developed 
locker as a batch file, it is simple it just hide the folder what
we do in windows physically but this is automated process to do
the physical thing and compare the password what you give in the
time of signup & it also have recovery option you want to give recovery code
in it to access this (note : as i say it is batch file so i don't put
any encryption to password it saves the password in a text file 
[suggestion : by your programming knowledge example python by using
cryptography.ferent library to encrypt the pass and compare in the batch file),
{in windows people don't use cmd regularly but the one who access that 
he can do whatever he want's}

it just hide your folder in plain sight.
